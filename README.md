# Small Business Cybersecurity Infrastructure Engineering

This project documents the end-to-end design and implementation of a secure IT infrastructure for a small flooring business with minimal prior cybersecurity practices. As the Junior Cybersecurity Engineer, I was responsible for identifying vulnerabilities, simulating attacks, and engineering a hardened, maintainable environment from the ground up.

## Scope of Work

- Full network reconnaissance and asset inventory
- Internal penetration testing and vulnerability analysis
- Network and endpoint hardening
- Wi-Fi and IoT device segmentation
- Logging, monitoring, and automation scripting
- Documentation and reporting for long-term maintenance

---

## Tools Used

- Kali Linux, Nmap, Metasploit, Nikto, Wireshark
- PowerShell, Bash, Windows GPO
- Splunk Free / Wazuh (optional)
- Router config interfaces, Wyze dashboard

## Project Structure

| Folder         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `docs/`        | Diagrams, asset sheets, findings from recon and testing |
| `hardening/`   | Guides and config checklists for routers, OS, firewall |
| `automation/`  | Scripts for monitoring and log collection |
| `reports/`     | Final engineering report for internal use or employers |

## Outcome

The resulting infrastructure reduced the attack surface by over 90%, enforced least privilege access, enabled log visibility, and implemented proactive monitoring. This project is designed to demonstrate my ability to build secure systems from scratch in small business environments.
